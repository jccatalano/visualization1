This is my repository for my 1st visualization essay for Clio II.

This repository contains the code used to create my first visualization essay for Clio II. It is based on data from the [A New Nation Votes](http://elections.lib.tufts.edu/) dataset. An html version of my essay can be viewed [here](https://jccatalano.github.io/visualization1/01-first-viz.html).
